# Pixar-Films-Legacy 
Maven Pixar Challenge
## Objective: 
To analyze and showcase the legacy of Pixar Films over the last 30 years through effective storytelling, using an infographic or interactive visual. 
## Dataset: 
CSV files with structured information about every Pixar film from Toy Story (1995) to Inside Out 2 (2024). It lists each filmâ€™s creators (storywriters, screenwriters, directors, composers, and producers), budget, box-office earnings, critic ratings, Oscar nominations, genres, audience rating and more. 
## Approach: 
### Data Cleaning: 
- Used SQL to clean and prepare data. Formatted the release_date column to (yyyy-mm-dd), for SQL to take it as a date data type.
- Found a missing value for budget for a film (**_Luca_**) and since it wasn't even mentioned in the official site I accounted for it in my calculations.
